Manual Calculation
----------------------------------

Manual Calculation consists of 3 steps:
Step 1 - Extraxt Data
Step 2 - Calculate Data
Step 3 - Delete extracted tables manually



Step 1
------------
First it is necessary to extract data from main stat table 'cr_detect_results', because data calculation (in Step 2) proceeds from these extracted tables. It is possible to extract data for year and months.

To extract data use following command lines:

- Extract year only
php "manual_extr_year_month.php" 2016
this will extract data for year 2016 and store it in table 'cr_detect_results__year_2016'


- Extract months
php "manual_extr_year_month.php" 2016 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12
this will extract data for year 2016 and for all 12 months in this year, following tables will be created:
'cr_detect_results__year_2016'
'cr_detect_results__year_2016__month_01'
'cr_detect_results__year_2016__month_02'
'cr_detect_results__year_2016__month_03'
...
'cr_detect_results__year_2016__month_12'

totally 13 tables.

Keep in mind that if you want to extract data only for months from some year then data for this year also will be extracted, because extraction of months proceeds from extracted years table (for example from 'cr_detect_results__year_2016') .

Also, you can extract any number of months, for example to extract data for January, March and May of 2020 use this command line:
php "manual_extr_year_month.php" 2020 1-3-5
and you will get 4 tables:
'cr_detect_results__year_2020'
'cr_detect_results__year_2020__month_01'
'cr_detect_results__year_2020__month_03'
'cr_detect_results__year_2020__month_05'

Note: on evry next run all existing tables will be skipped, for example if you want to extract data for January of 2016 and table 'cr_detect_results__year_2016__month_01' already exists then it will not be extracted again or if you want to calculate data for some months of 2016 and table 'cr_detect_results__year_2016' already exists then data for year will not be extracted and countinue extraction of provided months from existing years table. So, if you want to re extract data again then first delete existing tables. 


Step 2
------------
When you have already extracted data you can start manual calculation of statistical data for years and months, it is possible to calculate data for year only, for month only and for both (year and month).

To calculate statistical data use following command lines:

- Calculate data for year only
php "manual_calc_year_month.php" 2016 0 YEAR
this will calculate data for year 2016

- Calculate data for month only
php "manual_calc_year_month.php" 2016 1 MONTH
this will calculate data for January of 2016

- Calculate data for both
php "manual_calc_year_month.php" 2016 1 BOTH
this will calculate data for year 2016 and for January of 2016

Finally you will get new archive database, for example 'curadio_cache_2016' and new archive tables in it for all filters grouped by months, for example: 'track_played_by_country__month_01', 'track_played_by_country__month_02', 'track_played_by_continent__month_01', 'track_played_by_continent__month_02', etc.

Note: if archive database already exists then script continue working, but if some archive table already exists (even if it is empty) then script will skip calculation for this table, so if you want to recalculate data for some month then relevant archive table should be deleted if it exists already.


Step 3
------------
Just delete extracted tables by hand if you don't need them anymore.
